# JSBot
A Javascript Selfbot Me And A Guy Were Working On Back In December Or January

> [Original Source Code](https://replit.com/@MannyCodes/Narv-Motion-selfbot?v=1) | 
> Made By cellrd And Motion

# Usage
Open Discord And Ctrl + Shift And Press i. Navigate To Console And Paste The Code In Velocity.js There And Press Enter. It Will Load In All The Functions Of The Code And You Can Use It Via Entering Commands With Console By Doing (eg. "export_chat()", etc). Usage Is The Same Way You Run Functions In Javascript And Python.

> P.S. This Selfbot Is Unfinished And Is A Long Way From Being Finished At The Moment. This Is An Experimental Version Of It That Most Likely Will Be Ran Wrong By Smooth Brains.
