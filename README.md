# Usage
Open Discord And Ctrl + Shift And Press i. Navigate To Console And Paste The Code From Velocity.js In The Input Prompt And Press Enter. It Will Load In All The Functions Of The Code Into Discord As Discords PC App Uses The discord.com Site HTML To Make The PC App Usable And For Browser Its The Same Thing Except Its Not The App. You Can Use Velocity Via Entering Commands With Console By Doing (eg. "export_chat()" Into The Input Prompt, etc). Usage Is Basically The Same Way You Run Functions In Javascript And Python.

> P.S. This Selfbot Is Unfinished And Is A Long Way From Being Finished At The Moment. This Is An Experimental Version Of It That Most Likely Will Be Ran Incorrectly By Smooth Brained People.
